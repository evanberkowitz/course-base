This is a quiz, it's a short exam.

\begin{itemize}
	\item	Start by doing question 0 on this page---the honor pledge.
	\item	Look over the exam before beginning.
	\item	There are FIVE questions.  Do them ALL.
	\item	They are worth 10, 20, 20, 20, and 30 points, respectively.  The exam is out of 100.  Manage your time wisely; partial credit is available.
	\item	I have put each question on its own page.  
	\item	{\bf There is a collection of possibly-useful integrals and reminders at the end of this exam.}
	\item	Please join \href{}{the regularly-scheduled zoom} to hear any clarifications I might offer.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Write large and legibly!}
